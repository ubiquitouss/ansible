ansible_facts: ansible_facts is a special dictionary in Ansible 
that holds all the facts gathered about a remote host. 
It's automatically populated with information during playbook execution.

When it says, "is added to the root of the facts namespace," 
it means that the ansible_facts dictionary is available at the top level or 
root of the facts hierarchy. In other words, 
you can access facts within ansible_facts directly without needing to traverse 
nested dictionaries or structures.

So, when a module returns a dictionary of ansible_facts, 
those facts are made easily accessible at the top level of the facts namespace. 
This allows Ansible users to conveniently access and use the 
information gathered by that module without needing to dig deep into nested structures.



Output results were like 

ansible_facts": {
        "ansible_apparmor": {
            "status": "disabled"
        },
        "ansible_architecture": "x86_64",
        "ansible_cmdline": {

Now in playbook we wrote the code like 

 tasks:
    - name: Show IP Address
      debug:
        msg: "{{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}"


We ignored ansible_facts" which is at the top

note: in tutoral there was "ansible_default_ipv4.address" 

here we have section like: ansible_date_time"

accordinh to our code we could write it like 

 tasks:
    - name: Show IP Address
      debug:
        msg: "{{ ansible_date_time }}"
