# YAML documents begin with the document separator ---
 
# The minus in YAML this indicates a list item.  The playbook contains a list
# of plays, with each play being a dictionary
-
 
  # Hosts: where our play will run and options it will run with
  hosts: 10.0.0.1
  gather_facts: True
 
  # Vars: variables that will apply to the play, on all target systems

  # Tasks: the list of tasks that will be executed within the playbook
  tasks:
    - name: Test hostvars with an ansible fact and collect ansible_port, dot notation
      debug:
        msg: "{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname].ansible_port }}"

    - name: Test groupvars
      debug:
        msg: "{{ ansible_user }}"


#! I had to change the file name in host_vars to ip address instead of 10.0.0.1 was centos1 and 10.0.0.7 was ubuntu-c
#! ansible_hostname and ansible_user combination in line 18 and 22 didn't work. so i had to change it to inventory and ansible combination
#! difference between inventory and ansible keyword is most probably:
#! inventory means it's default name by the system
#! ansible means if you set the name by yourself. like in the tutorial did. he renamed the hostname as centos1,centos2,centos3
#! to access the variables filename also had to be changed as the host name. like here i changed it to ip address. because the host had no name on it

# Three dots indicate the end of a YAML document
